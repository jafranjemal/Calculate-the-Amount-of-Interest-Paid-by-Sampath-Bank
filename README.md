# Calculate-the-Amount-of-Interest-Paid-by-Sampath-Bank

As a bank account holder, it can be difficult to keep track of how much interest has been paid since the account was opened. This can be a particular concern for Muslims, who may avoid receiving interest payments due to religious reasons.

In Islamic finance, interest (or "riba" in Arabic) is considered haram (forbidden), as it is seen as a form of exploitation that can lead to economic injustice. Instead, Islamic financial institutions use profit-and-loss sharing models, or other Sharia-compliant financing methods, to avoid interest payments.

However, for Muslims who hold accounts with conventional banks, it can be challenging to determine the total amount of interest paid over time. A simple script can be used to calculate the total interest amount paid by a bank such as Sampath Bank.

The script, which can be easily copied and pasted, uses a combination of querySelector and forEach functions to identify the interest payments in a bank account statement and add them up to get the total amount. The output of the script is displayed in a user-friendly format that can be easily interpreted.

By using this script, Muslims can easily calculate the total amount of interest paid by Sampath Bank. However, it is important to note that this is for educational purposes only and is not meant to be a tool to block interest payments or to stop using conventional banks.

In fact, using this script may encourage bank management to provide a filter and sum of interest fee in their web application, which can be a useful feature for all account holders.


as a Muslim, it's important to be mindful of the halal and haram aspects of interest payments, and to make informed decisions about one's financial transactions. This script can be a useful tool to help calculate the total amount of interest paid by a conventional bank
